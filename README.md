Abstract

Increasing the Efficiency of Analyzing Direct Observations to Quantify Children’s Exposure to Environmental Hazards

By Noah Reiner

Purpose: Video observation can be used to understand children’s exposure to environmental hazards; however, it is both expensive to gather and time-consuming to code. Generally, coding of video data requires significantly more time than the time it takes to collect the data. Is it possible to code only a subset of the data and still accurately capture the mean and median mouthing frequencies and population-level variation in the data?

Methods: Our algorithm cleans and defines our data and defines hand-to-mouth contacts, before dividing our training data into user specified subsets. We then calculate the proportion of subset 90% CIs which contain the true SD of hand-to-mouth contacts per hour.

Results: We demonstrate the use-case of this tool using data coded video data collected to document how observational environmental health studies of children in Bangladesh interact with their environment. Our results suggest that regardless of the percent of video coded, the created subsets will largely contain the test population standard deviation of hand-to-mouth contacts per hour.

Conclusions: Hand-to-mouth contacts are largely distributed evenly across hours, meaning that coding portions of each hour may be an effective way to reduce the time it takes to code video data. Although we have created the foundation for an interactive and useful tool for researchers, further research is necessary before publication of our tool and general use in other observational studies of children’s exposures to environmental hazards.
